1.1.1
-----
* Added basic SDF support.
* Improved the behaviour of selecting the next node when the current one is removed.

1.1.0
-----
* This version is the result of refactoring the "format" support in the Core to better support different formats in the future.
* To support these features, refactored parsing of molecular and desnity data.
  - This introduces a few breaking changes. 
  - Most of these changes happen in the Plugin Spec. 
  - Outside of the spec, the most notable change change is renaming Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromCif to Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Molecule.CreateFromMmCif and Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseCcp4 to Bootstrap.Entity.Transformer.Density.ParseBinary.
  - Refer to changelogs for Core, Bootstrap, and Plugin for more details.
* Added the ability to download/open/parse old PDB files.

1.0.14
------
* Added query flatten and function Fragment.find(query). (for example residuesByName('ALA').flatten(f => f.find(atomsByElement('C')))).

1.0.13
------
* Added xs.intersectWith(ys) query.
* Fixed and issue with ambientResidues/Atoms query when used inside "inside" query.

1.0.12
------
* Updated some internals (the way "collapsed" transforms are handled).

1.0.11
------
* Added behaviour to unselect elements on repeated click.

1.0.10
------
* Added BRIX density data support.

1.0.9
-----
* Fixed mouse issues related to scrollbar position.
* Toggling expand no longer resets scrollbar position to 0.
